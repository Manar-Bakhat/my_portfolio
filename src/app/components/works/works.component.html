              This project involves developing a free home services platform that connects workers and clients to exchange benefits. Workers can post free ads detailing their services, including their age, phone number, city, and region. Clients can search for workers offering the services they need based on specific criteria (service name, city, area) and directly contact the workers through the app or by phone.
