            <h3>LabGenius Project</h3>
            <p>
              I participated in the digitalization of the measurement testing process at 
              TE Connectivity's laboratory. The goal was to automate the management of test requests 
              and improve the traceability of operations. I contributed to the development of a web 
              application to facilitate the management of tests and reports.

            <h3>Speedy</h3>
            <p>
              This project involves developing a free home services platform that connects workers and clients to exchange benefits. Workers can post free ads detailing their services, including their age, phone number, city, and region. Clients can search for workers offering the services they need based on specific criteria (service name, city, area) and directly contact the workers through the app or by phone.
            </p>
            <p>
              The platformâ€™s goal is not only to foster cooperation but also to promote sharing, emotional connection, and a sense of collaboration.
